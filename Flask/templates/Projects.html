                Testing 123 I learned pretty early that the best way I learn is by doing, plain and simple. There is only so much I can learn from reading tutorials or sitting in the classroom; at some point I have to dive in and face things head on. This thought process has been the foundation for all of these projects. All of these projects were inspired by different instances, some as class projects, some while sitting with friends at Hackathons, and most just sitting by myself wondering what I'm doing with my life. Either way, I've ending up learning a lot from each one of these projects and have become a better programmer because of them. Check out <a href="http://github.com/vrk7bp"> my GitHub </a> to see my code or keep track of what I'm working on lately.

                            There isn't a day that goes by where I haven't checked <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_newtab"> Hacker News</a> atleast four to five times. But I don't always go through all of the top articles of the day, and instead find myself picking articles that are more related to topics such as Cloud Computing and entrepreneurship. This was the inspiration for HackerFeed. Along with two of my friends, <a href="http://github.com/mantazer" target="_newtab"> Muntaser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/a-beck" target="_newtab"> Andrew</a>, we decided to create a Hacker News reader application that would take into account the articles that you have read in order to reorganize the typical ordered feed coming from Hacker News directly.

                            Inspired by the heroic 2014 NBA Finals win by the San Antonio Spurs. As a way to celebrate the win, and tease my Miami Heat friend, I decided to make an e-mail application that would send a different picture of Tim Duncan (as well as a random quote) to anyone who chose to sign up for the e-mail list. I used the <href a="https://developers.google.com/custom-search/" target="_newtab"> Custom Google Search API </href> and <href a="https://sendgrid.com/" target="_newtab"> SendGrid API </href>  to set this up, and am currently running on an AWS micro instance as a daily cronjob. For a period of time, I also set this application to run every hour in order to spam my Miami Heat fan with Tim Duncan photos. I regret nothing.

                            The code for this project is relatively simple (not more than 100 actual lines of code), and setting up a Cron Job on an AWS instance can be done in less than a minute.

                            I decided after the Fall 2014 semester to take on the project of building my own website. I had just gotten comfortable with the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_newtab"> Flask web server</a>, and had played around with various cloud services such as Amazon Web Services and Google App Engine. I figured that building my own personal website would be the perfect way to build on what I had picked up from the previous semester, and the perfect opportunity to learn HTML and CSS (which I had very minimal experience with prior). What I am most proud of about this website is that I started literally from nothing and built this website myself. I built the server using Flask, figured out how to run it on GAE (which was a total pain), learned the HTML and CSS, and created a beautiful website. For a more in-depth look into how this site was created and my process, check out my <a href="http://gautamk.us/aboutsite"> About This Site page</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At some point soon, I hope to make a tutorial on the "programmer's guide to building a personal website". I will walk through building the Flask web server, putting it on App Engine, setting up a personal URL, and provide my HTML and CSS template for others to use. I figured it would be a fun little project that might help some people who are in the position I was in not too long ago.

                        <p>
                            PS: I apologize in advance for the insane amount of commits I made to this repository, and the horrific commit messages. I added Push-To-Deploy to my GAE application, therefore every push I made to GitHub updated my application in the backend. I picked up on the 'Inspect Element' tool on Chrome late in the process, so you will see a lot of very small, meager changes between commits.

                            The problem statement here was pretty simple. Using Python, we were tasked with creating our own rudimentary version of DropBox. The problem can be broken down into two separate sections, the client side which has to recognize file changes and "ping" the server accordingly and the server side which has to take into account these changes and update the other synchronized users accordingly. For the client side, we used the Python framework <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watchdog" target="_newtab"> WatchDog</a> in order to monitor files. WatchDog is extremely easy to use, providing you the ability to trigger events based on the file activity that happened (for example, you can have a different event triggered if a file is created versus deleted). On the sever side, we built a <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_newtab"> Flask web server</a> (again, very easy to use) and utilized its file transfer libraries in order to retrieve the updated files. At a basic level, we had each triggered WatchDog event hit a different endpoint of the Flask webserver so that the server could act accordingly. We also had another thread working in the background monitoring the server in case changes happen on another client's end (so that all machines that are accessing the server are updated). The Flask server was run on an AWS micro-instance.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although I worked in a group of three other students on this project, I can confidently  say that I did 95% of the coding for this project (as highlighted by <a href="https://github.com/vrk7bp/OneDir/graphs/contributors"> this graph</a>). Even though it wasn't the most ideal situation, especially during crunch time at the end of the semester, I really learned a lot from the project as a whole. From my experience building this OneDir system from back to front, I got comfortable picking up new libraries and frameworks that I knew nothing about and figuring out how to use them. I got really good with my debugging, google searching, and just general understanding of what to look for when figuring out new things.

                    <div class="text-left" id="content-color">

                        <p> 
                            MHacks was my second Hackathon, but the first one where I really had a grasp as to what I was doing as a programmer. I was lucky enough to fly up to Ann Arbor, Michigan with my great partner and good friend <a href="http://github.com/mantazer" target="_newtab"> Muntaser</a>, which helped make the experience a great one. Unfortunately we didn't have an idea going into the Hackathon, and failed to come up with something that we could both agree on for some time (we both don't consider ourselves to be the most creative). Eventually we were able to combine our love of sports with our passion for trash talking other people into a creative application that we built throughout the weekend.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            TrashTalk is an application that allows the user to navigate through their contacts and select the favorite NFL teams for each contact. Then, based upon the happenings on Sunday, the application will automatically send trash talk to your friends via text message. For example, let's say that my friend Bob was a Steelers fan. If the Steelers are playing the Ravens, and the Ravens score a touchdown, a text message will be sent from my phone with some randomly generated trash talk to Bob.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, we were unable to integrate the sports score API before we ran out of time. The application was 90% complete, with the UI to select teams in place and the text message generation working. We have yet to go back and integrate the sports API since we have moved on to working on other projects together. At some point we will come back and tie up all the loose ends on the app.

                        <p> Although I had learned JAVA in high school, and considered myself fairly competent with the language, I had never attempted any sort of mobile development before this class. Programming an Android application really pushes your program and JAVA skills to the test, and it was an experience I learned a lot from. Dealing with obstacles such as coordinating with the Google Maps API, understanding the intricacies of Android, and navigating through weird error messages really helped me gain a better appreciation of what it takes to be a great programmer and how important it is to stay organized as a programmer. </p>

                        <p> I worked on this application with three other students (randomly assigned) as our final project for the class. Just like with the Geography Toy mentioned below, I had not learned about the magic of GitHub yet and therefore did not make use of it. Therefore this repository has a very minimal amount of commits. As a side note, I highly recommend learning GitHub to anyone who is working on a group coding project. It makes your life so much easier. </p>

                    <h3> Fall 2011 [Introduction to Engineering Class] </h3>

                    <div class="text-left" id="content-color">
                        <p> My first real, overwhelming introduction to engineering and college came in the form of my first engineering class, ENGR 1620 (Introduction to Engineering). For the final project of the semester, me and a group of four other students were tasked with making a physical, educational toy for elementary aged students. As easy as this sounded, the overall scope of the project became apparent very quickly. Coordinating the programming of the toy with the physical aspect, while also making sure to fulfill the proper standards of learning in Virginia and including feedback from multiple sources, was extremely challenging. Although it there were some of bumps in the road and a lot of sleepless nights, I learned a lot from the project in the end. </p>

                        <p> On the programming end, the entire project was built in JAVA. Our toy was a Geography Toy that asked questions related to continents for students to answer. The students could physically select a continent by moving an arrow over what they believed the answer was (we coordinated with RFID tags in order to realize which continent was which). A GUI with a picture of the World Map, the question, and a students points was shown on a computer screen. As the student answered questions, the questions generated would be adjusted based on the percieved level of the student. </p>

                        <p> Unfortunately, I did not know the magic of GitHub or the importance of neat code at this point in my coding career. The code is really hard to follow and is very honed into the problem that we had.
