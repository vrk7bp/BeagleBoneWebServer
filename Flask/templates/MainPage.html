                <p> 
                    I learned pretty early that the best way I learn is by doing. There is only so much I can learn from reading tutorials or sitting in the classroom; at some point I have to dive in and face things head on. This thought process has been the foundation for all of these projects. Each one was inspired by different circumstances, some as class projects, some while working with friends at Hackathons, and most just sitting by myself wondering what I'm doing with my life. Either way, I've ending up learning a lot from each one of these projects and have become a better programmer because of them. Check out <a href="http://github.com/vrk7bp"> my GitHub </a> to see my code or keep track of what I'm working on lately.

                                After some frustrations hosting my website on Google App Engine and Azure, I decided that I would build my own web server. What was meant to be a quick one day project ended up growing into something much larger because there was so much to do and even more to learn. Early on, I decided to document my "adventure" in setting this up so that it could be a reference for me, and hopefully help others later on.

                                This project is going to be a constant work in progress because I plan to keep adding functionality to my server, as well as keep it as a "test harness" for any small projects that I work on that need a web backend.

                                There isn't a day that goes by where I haven't checked <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_newtab"> Hacker News</a> atleast four to five times. But I don't always go through all of the top articles of the day, and instead find myself picking articles that are more related to topics such as Cloud Computing and entrepreneurship. This was the inspiration for HackerFeed. Along with two of my friends, <a href="http://github.com/mantazer" target="_newtab"> Muntaser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/a-beck" target="_newtab"> Andrew</a>, we decided to create a Hacker News reader application that would take into account the articles that you have read in order to reorganize the typical ordered feed coming from Hacker News directly.

                                During large power outages, especially those caused by large storms, power suppliers waste lots of money and time trying to figure out which houses and neighborhoods have power and which don't. When Hurricane Sandy hit the New York/New Jersey area, it was estimated that power suppliers took thousands of trips out to the affected areas to simply figure out which houses had power and which ones didn't. This massive inefficiency was the inspiration for Project Pulsar. My partner <a href="http://github.com/mantazer" target="_newtab"> Muntaser</a> and I created a system that rests on the basic assumption that as long as a house has access to internet, that they have access to electricity. We used an Intel Galileo Embedded System to send http requests to a central Amazon EC2 server, with the idea that the embedded system represents the "sensor" in the house. With the server, we had a central database that kept track of the state of every embedded system on the network. When the server notices that one of the systems has been down longer than usual (meaning an http request hasn't been received  from the embedded system recently), we probe the Internet Service Provider (i.e. Comcast) via a Twilio Application in order to figure out if there is an Internet Outage on the side of the ISP as opposed to a power outage. Once this decision is made, and if it is determined that there is a Power Outage, the information is conveyed to the power distributor via a web client.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This project gained a lot of recognition at PennApps, especially by the hardware sponsors. However this system is still a work in progress. Although Project Pulsar as it stands may fit a basic use case, getting access to user's internet (with security and passwords) as well as configuring with the Internet Service Provider (so as to differentiate between a power outage and internet outage) has to be fleshed out more before this project can truly become scalable.

                                Inspired by the heroic 2014 NBA Finals win by the San Antonio Spurs. As a way to celebrate the win, and tease my Miami Heat friend, I decided to make an e-mail application that would send a different picture of Tim Duncan (as well as a random quote) to anyone who chose to sign up for the e-mail list. I used the <href a="https://developers.google.com/custom-search/" target="_newtab"> Custom Google Search API </href> and <href a="https://sendgrid.com/" target="_newtab"> SendGrid API </href>  to set this up, and had it running on an AWS micro instance as a daily cronjob.

                                The code for this project is relatively simple (not more than 100 actual lines of code), and setting up a Cron Job on an AWS instance can be done in less than a minute.

                                I decided after the Fall 2014 semester to take on the project of building my own website. I had just gotten comfortable with the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_newtab"> Flask web server</a>, and had played around with various cloud services such as Amazon Web Services and Google App Engine. I figured that building my own personal website would be the perfect way to build on what I had picked up from the previous semester, and the perfect opportunity to learn HTML and CSS (which I had very minimal experience with prior). What I am most proud of about this website is that I started literally from nothing and built this website myself. I built the server using Flask, figured out how to run it on GAE (which was a total pain), learned the HTML and CSS, and created a beautiful website. For a more in-depth look into how this site was created and my process, check out my <a href="#AboutSitePage"> About This Site page</a>.
                            </p>

							<p>
								Sometime around Spring 2016, I moved the backend for my website from Google App Engine to Microsoft Azure; which proved to be a surprisingly easy transition. Although there were slight variations in the structure of the repositories, the core content was kept the same (still the same Flask Server, HTML/CSS pages, et cetera). Then in Fall of 2016, I decided I would save a little money and build my own local web server using a BeagleBone Black.

                                PS: I apologize in advance for the insane amount of commits I made to this repository, and the horrific commit messages. I added Push-To-Deploy to my GAE application, therefore every push I made to GitHub updated my application in the backend. I picked up on the 'Inspect Element' tool on Chrome and the importance to testing locally late in the process, so you will see a lot of very small changes between commits.

                                The problem statement here was pretty simple. Using Python, we were tasked with creating our own rudimentary version of DropBox. The problem can be broken down into two separate sections, the client side which has to recognize file changes and "ping" the server accordingly and the server side which has to take into account these changes and update the other synchronized users accordingly. For the client side, we used the Python framework <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watchdog" target="_newtab"> WatchDog</a> in order to monitor files. WatchDog is extremely easy to use, providing you the ability to trigger events based on the file activity that happened (for example, you can have a different event triggered if a file is created versus deleted). On the sever side, we built a <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_newtab"> Flask web server</a> (very easy to use) and utilized its file transfer libraries to retrieve the updated files. At a basic level, we had each triggered WatchDog event hit a different endpoint of the Flask webserver so that the server could act accordingly. We also had another thread working in the background monitoring the server in case changes happen on another client's end (so that all machines that are accessing the server are updated). The Flask server was run on an AWS micro-instance.

                                MHacks was my second Hackathon, but the first one where I really had a grasp as to what I was doing as a programmer. I was lucky enough to fly up to Ann Arbor, Michigan with my go to partner <a href="http://github.com/mantazer" target="_newtab"> Muntaser</a>. Unfortunately we didn't have an idea going into the Hackathon, and failed to come up with something that we could both agree on for some time. Eventually we were able to combine our love of sports with our passion for trash talking other people into a creative application that we built throughout the weekend.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                TrashTalk is an application that allows the user to navigate through their contacts and select favorite NFL teams for each contact. Then, based upon the happenings on Sunday, the application will automatically send trash talk to your friends via text message. For example, let's say that my friend Bob was a Steelers fan. If the Steelers are playing the Ravens, and the Ravens score a touchdown, a text message will be sent from my phone with some randomly generated trash talk to Bob.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, we were unable to integrate the sports score API before we ran out of time. The application was 90% complete, with the UI to select teams in place and the text message generation working. We have yet to go back and integrate the sports API since we have moved on to working on other projects together.

                            <p> Although I had learned JAVA in high school, I had never attempted any sort of mobile development before this class. Programming an Android application really pushes your programming and JAVA skills to the test, and it was an experience I learned a lot from. Dealing with obstacles such as coordinating with the Google Maps API, understanding the intricacies of Android, and navigating through weird error messages really helped me gain a better appreciation of what it takes to be a great coder and how important it is to stay organized as a programmer. </p>

                            <p> I worked on this application with three other students (randomly assigned) as our final project for the class. Just like with the Geography Toy mentioned below, I had not learned about the magic of GitHub yet and therefore did not make use of it. Therefore this repository has a very minimal amount of commits.</p>

                            <p> My first real introduction to engineering and college came in the form of ENGR 1620, Introduction to Engineering. For the final project of the semester, me and a group of four other students were tasked with making an educational toy for elementary aged students. As easy as this sounded, the overall scope of the project became apparent very quickly. Coordinating the "virtual" backend of the toy with the physical aspect, while also making sure to fulfill the proper standards of learning in Virginia and including feedback from multiple sources, was extremely challenging. There were some bumps in the road and a lot of sleepless nights along the way, but the project turned out to be a success. </p>

                            <p> On the programming end, the entire project was built in JAVA. Our toy was a Geography Toy that asked questions related to continents for students to answer. The students could physically select a continent by moving an arrow over what they believed the answer was (we coordinated with RFID tags in order to realize which continent was currently selected). A GUI with a picture of the World Map, the question, and the player's points was shown on a computer screen. As the student answered questions, the questions generated would be adjusted based on the percieved level of the student. We also introduced a rudimentary tracking mechanism to give teachers more data when lesson planning. </p>

                            <p> Unfortunately, I did not know the magic of GitHub or the importance of neat code at this point in my coding career. So the code is really hard to follow.

                    Since my senior year in high school, I have been lucky enough to be on a part of a number of interesting research projects. Although these projects haven't been in my direct fields of study, they have been in areas that I am really interested in outside of school. This has allowed me to publish papers in a variety of different fields: environmental sciences, government policy analysis, and education.

                        <h3> Fall 2014 [Fourth Year of College] </h3>
                        As part of the Engineering Student Council at UVa, I ran the Student Taught Classes program for the Engineering School. This wildely successful program was founded in the Spring of 2013 with an <a href="http://shuklan.com/haskell/" target="_newtab">Introduction to Haskell </a> class, which had an enrollment of more than 50 students on campus and over 1,000 unique visitors online. After getting approval from the Dean of the Engineering School, we moved forward with a completely student-run Student Taught Classes program. More than a year later, we had offered nine classes through the program ranging in topics from Auto-Mechanics to Data Visualization. These classes were offered as one-credit pass/fail courses that don't fulfill any degree requirement. The sole purpose of the courses were to provide students with industry knowledge or techinical skills that aren't otherwise covered in the engineering curriculum. The program garnered a lot of <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/programming-languages-auto-mechanics-engineering-students-give-teaching-try" target="_newtab"> local media attention </a> and praise from professors and administrators around the school. My co-chair, Anish Simhal, and I teamed up with our dean and a professor to write a paper on the use of Student Taught Classes in the engineering curriculum. This paper got approved for the <a href="http://fie2014.org/" target="_newtab"> IEEE Frontiers in Education 2014 conference</a>!

                        During my internship with NASA in the summer of 2013, I worked in the Commercial Spaceflight Development Division. My main task during the summer was to research past partnerships that NASA had with private space companies in order to better quantify what factors differentiated successful partnerships from failures. My research for this assignment focused on reading through a number of GAO reports and going through more than a dozen interviews with the heads of the Human Exploration and Operations Directorate within NASA. This research culminated in this research paper, which was later circulated through NASA and published in the Virginia Engineering and Science Research Journal.

                        As my Independent Science Research project for my senior year of high school, I wanted to see if changes in Ultraviolet Radiation over time had any concurrent effects on population shifts. This was mostly a data analysis project that consisted of finding patterns between <a href="http://www.census.gov/2010census/" target="_newtab"> US Census data </a> and <a href="http://uvb.nrel.colostate.edu/UVB/index.jsf" target="_newtab"> UV Radiation data</a>. I also played around with some ArcGIS software to better visualize the data across the country. This was my first real in-depth research paper, and I was able to win enough prize money to pay for my college laptop from all the fairs and competitions I entered the project in.

                    Outside of class and code, I enjoy playing basketball with friends and try to volunteer as much as I can. At UVa, I was a board member for the Engineering Student Council, an elected position that came with a lot of responsibility. I'm was also a TA for CS 2110 (Software Development Methods), an Engineering School Tour Guide, and one of the organizers of <a href="http://hackuva.io/" target="_newtab"> Hack.UVa </a>. Having graduated, I've since switched over to coaching basketball and volunteering with the <a href="https://www.tealsk12.org/"> TEALS </a> program.

                    From a technology standpoint, I am really interested in Cloud Computing and have recently dived into learning about Operating Systems. I'm always pushing myself to learn new things, which causes me to work on a lot of <a href="#ProjectsPage"> projects </a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since August 2015, I've been a part of Microsoft as a Program Manager. I joined the Developer Ecosystem and Platform team, where we focus on all aspects of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide"> Universal Windows Platform </a>. However outside of this, I also have an interest in the Education Technology space. In particular, I would love to focus in on technology's ability to determine a student's weaknesses in a quick and effective way; this would hopefully allow teachers to come up with better and more focused lesson plans.

                <p> 
                    If you haven't seen it already, the code for this site can be found <a href="http://www.github.com/vrk7bp/beaglebonewebserver"> here</a>. This site is built using a Python Framework called <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_newtab"> Flask </a>. For anyone wanting to build their own site from scratch, I highly recommend using Flask. It is extremely easy to use and very intuitive. 
				</p>
				<p>				
					From a server standpoint, this site is running on a local server I setup myself. The <a href="http://www.github.com/vrk7bp/gautamwebsite"> original version of the site </a>  was hosted on Google App Engine, which proved to be a pain. Although the App Engine documentation makes it sound like it is very easy to run a Flask webserver on their machines, I did not find this to be the case. I spent many hours trying to figure out how to run Flask on Google's platform, and even considered jumping to Amazon Web Services a couple of times. One of the biggest problems is that unless the 3rd party application you want to use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/built-in-libraries-27" target="_newtab"> is on this list</a>, you have to physically download the necessary files and put them in the right hierarchy among your other folders and files related to the project. This got especially annoying with Flask, because Flask is built on other un-supported 3rd party libraries such as werkzeug and jinja2. 
                </p>
				<p>
					In the Spring of 2016, I decided to move to a Microsoft Azure backend. This proved to be relatively easy, especially because of Azure App Service's built in support for Flask. Following <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-python-create-deploy-flask-app/"> this page </a> proved to be all I really needed. I also setup my Azure instance to have <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-publish-source-control/"> Push-To-Deploy support </a> from my GitHub repo, making my life even easier.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the Fall of 2016, I made yet another pivot and built my own local server using a BeagleBone Black. Although a long process, I ended up learning a lot while also saving a little bit of money in the long-term. I plan on using this server beyond hosting my website, using it as my remote Dev Machine as well as a host for any other small projects I work on that prove to need a web server. The process I went through to build this can be found <a href="http://github.com/vrk7bp/beaglebonewebserver"> here. </a>
				</p>
				<p>
					For those of you who aren't interested in learning how to build and host a backend websever, I recommend looking into <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_newtab"> GitHub Pages</a>. GitHub Pages is perfect for those people who are more worried about the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because it abstracts away the Web Server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So why did I build this site? The more and more I have gotten into programming, the quicker I have realized that I learn by doing. There is only so much I can get out of reading a tutorial or typing some lines on Codecademy. At some point you just have to really dive in. This site was my version of diving into web development. I had learned about building a basic web server and the power of Flask before, but I had absolutely no knowledge of building websites and figured this would be the perfect opportunity to learn. Throw in the fact that I learned a bit about using various cloud providers, and I would say that it was an overall great experience that was well worth while.
