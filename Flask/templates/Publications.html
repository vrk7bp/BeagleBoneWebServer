            <p> 
                Since my senior year in high school, I have found an interest in doing research. Although the research that I've been able to get published has not been in my direct fields of study, they have been in areas that I am really interested in outside of school. Each one of my publications have been in a different field: environmental sciences, government policy analysis, and engineering education.

                    <h1>Exploring the Use of Student Taught Classes to Introduce New Technical Topics to Engineering Undergraduates</h1>
                    <h3> Fall 2014 [Fourth Year of College] </h3>
                    As part of the Engineering Student Council at UVa, I run the Student Taught Classes program for the Engineering School. This wildely successful program was founded in the Spring of 2013 with an <a href="http://shuklan.com/haskell/" target="_newtab">Introduction to Haskell </a> class. With an enrollment of more than 50 students on campus, and over 1,000 unique visitors online, we knew that we had something special. After getting approval from the Dean of the Engineering School, we moved forward with a completely student-run Student Taught Classes program. More than a year later, we have offered seven classes through the program ranging in topics from Auto-Mechanics to Data Visualization. These classes are offered as one-credit pass/fail courses that don't fulfill any degree requirement. The sole purpose of the courses are to provide students with industry knowledge or techinical skills that aren't otherwise covered in the engineering curriculum. This program has garnered a lot of <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/programming-languages-auto-mechanics-engineering-students-give-teaching-try" target="_newtab"> local media attention </a> and praise from professors and administrators around the school. My co-chair, Anish Simhal, and I teamed up with our dean and a professor to write a paper on the use of Student Taught Classes in the engineering curriculum. We were lucky enough to get this paper approved for the <a href="http://fie2014.org/" target="_newtab"> IEEE Frontiers in Education 2014 conference</a>!

                    <h1>The Creation of Effective Partnerships between NASA and Private Companies</h1>
                    <h3> Spring 2014 [Third Year of College] </h3>
                    During my internship with NASA in the summer of 2013, I worked in the Commercial Spaceflight Development Division. My main task during the summer was to research past partnerships that NASA had with private space companies in order to better quantify what factors differentiated successful partnerships from failures. My research for this assignment focused on reading through a number of GAO reports and going through more than a dozen interviews with the heads of the Human Exploration and Operations Directorate within NASA. This research culminated in this research paper, which was circulated through NASA (all the way to the NASA Administrator's office) and published in the Virginia Engineering and Science Research Journal.

                    <h1>The Effect of Ultraviolet Radiation on Population Shifts</h1>
                    <h3> Spring 2011 [Senior Year of High School] </h3>
                    As my Independent Science Research project for my senior year of high school, I decided to work on a project that combined Behavioral Science with Environmental Science. I wanted to see if changes in Ultraviolet Radiation over time had any concurrent effects on population shifts. This was mostly a data analysis project that consisted of analyzing a combination of <a href="http://www.census.gov/main/www/access.html" target="_newtab"> US Census data </a> and <a href="http://uvb.nrel.colostate.edu/UVB/index.jsf" target="_newtab"> UV Radiation data</a>. I also played around with some ArcGIS software to better visualize the data across the country. This was my first real in-depth research paper, and I was able to win enough prize money to pay for my college laptop from all the fairs and competitions I entered the project in.
